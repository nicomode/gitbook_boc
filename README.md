# Bank of Chain Documentation

## Introduction

Official documentation for BOC. This repo is used to sync changes from Markdown files (.md) with the DOC's website. The different repository branches are tracked by GitBook to feed each language variant on the documentation.

## Updating versions

Use the following steps to update a specific version. For example, to update the Chinese docs:

- Fork this repository ```gitbook_boc``` to your repositories.

- Clone the forked repo and change to the branch you want to work on.
```
git clone https://github.com/your_github_user/gitbook_boc.git
git checkout zh
```
- You will do the changes, ```add``` and ```commit``` everything and ```push``` the zh branch to Github
```
git add .
git commit -m "new commit"
git push
```

- Go to the original repository and create a pull request from the branch on your forked repository committed branch to the same branch on the original repository.

- After the pull request is accepted you go to the documentation website and confirm everything updated as expected. It may take a minute or two for the changes to sync.
